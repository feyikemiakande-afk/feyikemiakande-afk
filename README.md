## 🚀 About Me 
I’m a **Juniour data analyst** with a strong interest in helping businesses make sense of their data. I enjoy transforming complex datasets into clear stories and practical insights that support informed decision making.

I’m also a **business analyst enthusiast**, interested in understanding business problems, defining KPIs, and translating requirements into data-driven solutions. My focus is on building dashboards that actually get used, automating repetitive tasks to improve efficiency, and creating analytical models that support planning and performance tracking.

Outside of working with data, I enjoy learning new tools, continuously improving my analytical skills, and reading books.
